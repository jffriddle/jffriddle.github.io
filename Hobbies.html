	<h2>Video Games</h2>
	<p>One of my favorite past times is playing video games.  I like playing video games both by myself and with friends.  I like the camaraderie playing video games with friends creates.  If I'm not doing schoolwork from the time I wake up until dinner time 99.9% of the time I am playing video games.</p>
<h3>My top 5 favorite Video games:</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Genshin impact</li>
	  <li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
	  <li>Destiny 2</li>
	  <li>PlateUp!</li>
	  <li>New World</li>
	</ol>

<h2>TV Shows</h2>
	  <p>As well as playing video games I also really enjoy watching television shows.  After dinner until I go to bed I spend my night watching TV.  I spend most of my time watching Crime/Drama TV shows but there are many that I like.  I also sometimes watch tv shows with my mom when we have some free time together.  These are just a few of my favorites.</p>
