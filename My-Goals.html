	<h1>After I graduate</h1>
	<p>I have many goals planned for after I graduate.  The main thing I have planned for after I graduate is my friend and I are planning to open a store together.  The store will be based in Florida and I am going to use my degree to help set up the website for the store.  I may only work part time at the store so I can also get a job in either the private or government sector.  My friend promised me either way he would be very flexible with my hours so that I could make the most out of my degree.</p>
	
	<h1>Once the store opens</h1>
	<p>Once the store opens I will keep the website up and running and make sure that the website is secure.  My friend also offered me a security guard position there part time should I want it.  Once the store is running I will maintain the website and update it as needed.  While running the website and working at the store I could do a side hustle of working as a programmer for other companies.</p>
