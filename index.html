	<p>Hello my name is James Friddle. I was born September 26, 1992 and am 30 years old.  I spent most of my childhood growing up in Summerfield north Carolina and now reside in the triad area of North Carolina. I grew up in a two-parent Christian household.  I have one older sister who is 33 years old.  I currently am enrolled in a Community College in North Carolina and am majoring in Cyber Security.  I have always found computers very interesting and loved tinkering with them.  Technology has always piqued my interest and I am always wanting to learn more about the newest gadgets whenever they come out. </p>
	<h2>My Beliefs</h2>
	<p>As I said before I grew up in a Christian household.  Even though being raised by Christian parents I didn't really fully accept God into my life until my freshman year in college (2012).  Even though I am a Christian I still have some beliefs that "old timey" Christians my not believe in.  I guess you would call this the modern day Christian.  I am definitely an ally of the LGBTQ community.  I have many friends who are gay or pan.</p>
	
	<h2>My life experience</h2>
	<p>My life experience so far has been quite an interesting one.  It has taught me that I need to be careful in who to trust and who I choose to be friends with.  There's definitely been a lot of ups and alot of down's in my life.  However I still try to look at everything with a positive outlook.  I used to tend to wear my heart on my sleeve but through my life experiences it taught me life can be hard and you need to shield and protect it.</p><br>
