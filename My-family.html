		<h2>My mom</h2>
	
	<img src="mom.jpg" alt="My mom is an amazing Woman" class="img_float"><p>My mom was born October 23, 1957.  She was born in Lexington, North Carolina and was one of five children.  My mom has been there for me through it all.  Through thick and then she has always stood up and fought for me.   There have been times in my life when I didn't know how I was going to get through things, but she would stand by my side and always tell me that I would get through it.  She is my best friend and greatest role model in life.  My mom loves watching TV shows with me.  She is the greatest mom there is because she always checks on me and ensures I'm okay no matter what. Growing up my mom and I got along better than I did with my dad but I think that was because my dad worked more than my mom did.  I know no matter what my mom will always be there and take care of what problems I have when things are going wrong.</p>

<h2>My Grandmother</h2>
<img src="grandma.jpg" alt="My grandmother is always there for me." class="img_float"> <p>Although not a blood relative of mine, I call this incredible inspiring woman my grandmother.  Even though I have only known her for two years I feel like I have known her my whole life. She has been such a huge inspiration and one of my role models in my life.  She is my biggest cheerleader and always wants the best for me.  I know whenever something is going wrong I can call on her and she will do everything in her power to fix it. She always knows how to make me laugh and can put a smile on my face even when I am in a bad mood.  She is one of the people who keeps me fighting.She is always the life of the party and knows how to have a good time and puts a smile on everyones face.</p>
