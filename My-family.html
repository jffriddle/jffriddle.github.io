		<h2>My mom</h2>
	
	<img src="Assets/mom.jpg" alt="My mom is an amazing Woman" class="img_float"><p>My mom was born October 23, 1957.  She was born in Lexington, North Carolina and was one of five children.  My mom has been there for me through it all.  Through thick and then she has always stood up and fought for me.   There have been times in my life when I didn't know how I was going to get through things, but she would stand by my side and always tell me that I would get through it.  She is my best friend and greatest role model in life.  My mom loves watching TV shows with me.  She is the greatest mom there is because she always checks on me and ensures I'm okay no matter what. Growing up my mom and I got along better than I did with my dad but I think that was because my dad worked more than my mom did.  I know no matter what my mom will always be there and take care of what problems I have when things are going wrong.</p>

Even though I have only known her for two years I feel like I have known her my whole life. She has been such a huge inspiration and one of my role models in my life.  She is my biggest cheerleader and always wants the best for me.  I know whenever something is going wrong I can call on her and she will do everything in her power to fix it. She always knows how to make me laugh and can put a smile on my face even when I am in a bad mood.  She is one of the people who keeps me fighting.She is always the life of the party and knows how to have a good time and puts a smile on everyones face.</p>

	<h2>My sister</h2>
	<img src="Assets/ethy.jpg" alt="My rolemodel" class="img_float">
	<p>Even though they are not my blood sister this INCREDIBLE human being I call my sister.  They're name is ethy and their pronounse are they/them.  I have only known ethy for a little over two years but I feel like I have known them my whole life.  I met ethy on twitch during a raid and we have been inseperable ever since.  We pretty much talk on the phone on discord daily if not every other day.  They may drive me crazy sometimes but I love them to death.  They are my role and my closest support and friend.  I know I can go to them about absolutely anything and they will give me their honest opinion and support.  I don't know what I would do without their friendship.</p>

<h2>My other sister</h2>
	<img src="Assets/sarah.jpg" alt="other sis" class="img_float">
	<p>This great incredible human being is my blood sister.  They were born October 22 1989.  Even though we don't talk alot Sarah is one of my best friends.  Even though we don't spend alot of time together the time we do spend together we will usually spend together playing Genshin Impact or other video games over the internet.  Growing up together we always loved spending time together.  Sure she would have time where she would want to do things with her friends and not want to be bothered by her younger brother.  However I think we were different than most siblings in the fact that we did spend most of our time together.</p>

<h2>My dad</h2>	
	<img src="Assets/dad.jpg" alt="dad" class="img_float">
	<p>My dad is an incredible man.  Thomas Franklin Friddle was born April 13 1954. He and I didn't get along to great growing up but as I got older he and I got a ton closer.  He is the definition of someone who tells "dad jokes" all the time but I love him for it even though it makes me roll my eyes.  He and I rip on each other alot but I love him for it.  I know I can go to him for anything and he won't judge me and he will keep a level head and give me the advice I need to hear.  He is one of my closest friends and I will always love him. </p>
