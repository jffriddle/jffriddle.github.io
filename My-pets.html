	<h2>My dogs</h2>
	<img src="Assets/dogs.jpg" alt="puppies" class="img_float">
	<p>I have two dogs.  The one on the left in the picture is named Theia and the one on the right is named Percy.  Theia is the biggest baby and sweetheart you will ever meet while percy is a wild child and a little bit of a demon.  We are trying to train Percy to get along better with people and other dogs but he is still having a little bit of trouble getting it down.  Theia sleeps in my bed every once and a while and has been living with us for a couple years now.  Percy has been living with us for about the same time.  Even though they have two different personalities I love them both equally and call them my four legged children.</p>

	<h2>My cats</h2>
	<img src="Assets/cats.jpg" alt="kitties" class="img_float">
	<p>I have three cats.  They were rescued by my sister and mom. They are Yuki, Tiger, and Arwen (from left to right).  Yuki and Arwen are brother and sister and we have had them both the longest.  We got them both when our neighbors moved out and left them underneath their house in the cross base and we rescued them.  Tiger wondered up to our house and we took him in.  The three of them are the biggest babies and are super sweet.  Tiger and Yuki are the two that beg for the most attention but Arwen will still ask for it sometimes.  I am not much of a cat person but these three have really grown on me and I do love them.</p>
